# Digital-Cyber_Crime-Analytics

### Objectives:
1. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key factors influencing cybercrime risks.
2. Implement machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict risk levels.
3. Build visualizations to identify trends and high-risk areas.

### Skills Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Predictive Analytics
